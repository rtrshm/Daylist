### This project is no longer maintained due to [Spotify disabling retrieval](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api) of their auto-curated playlists through the API.

# Daylist

Spotify does not let you expose auto-curated playlists to the public. When you add one of these to your profile, others can see that you've added them but a click will lead them to the playlist curated for the viewer, as opposed to the publishing profile. This service keeps track of your daylist and automatically copies it over into a publically-displayable playlist whenever the former updates.
